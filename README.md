# React_Portfolio

This repository holds my current online portfolio created using react.

The online portfolio has the following features:
<ul>
    <li>An always active navbar containing a picture of myself and many links including:
        <ul>
            <li>My LinkedIn</li>
            <li>My Github</li>
            <li>A PDF of my resume</li>
            <li>an "about me" page</li>
            <li>a contact page</li>
            <li>a portfolio page</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>An "about me" page that contains a little bit of information about me</li>
    <li>A contact page that will allow users to contact me through the page</li>
    <li>A portfolio page that shows a few projects that I have made (along with links to their repositories and deployed
        sites)</li>

</ul>

All pages are designed mobile-first and look great on small and large screens with a simple unbusy look.
